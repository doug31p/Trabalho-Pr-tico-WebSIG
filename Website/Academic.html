           <h2> Remote sensing techniques to detect areas with potential for lithium exploration in Minas Gerais, Brazil</h2>
        <h3>Conference Paper - Published in 2019, Porto - Portugal</h3>
        <p>Lithium (Li) is defined as an alkaline metal which does not exist in nature in its free form. Moreover, it has properties that make it possible to be applied in several manners, such as industrial use, especially in the ceramic and glass industries, as well as the battery industry which has had an increase in this element consumption. It is crucial to use less expensive and faster techniques, compared to classical and intrusive methods, to identify new Li deposits. Remote sensing as proved to be a powerful tool to identify areas with potential for Li exploration. The objective of this work is to apply several images processing techniques, such as RGB band combinations, Band Ratios and Principal Components Analysis (PCA) to identify potential areas for Li prospection in the pegmatite district of São João Del Rei, located in the south of the state of Minas Gerais, Brazil. In these areas, two study zones were defined: the zone A, with approximately 323 km² in the pegmatite district of São João Del Rei and the zone B with approximately 90 km² in the pegmatite district of Araçuaí. The results of the techniques applied in this study are very promising since, in addition to ease and low cost, these techniques can be applied to several locations. This approach is highly valuable for the Li mining industry.</p>

        <h2> Temporal Analysis of Mining Expansion in the Conservation Unit - APA Estadual Sul RMBH</h2>
        <h3> Academic Study, Porto - Portugal</h3>
        <p>With the basic objective of protecting biological diversity, controlling the occupation process and ensuring the sustainable use of natural resources, the Environmental Protection Areas (APA’s) are a fundamental resource for environmental protection. Taking into account that APA SUL RMBH, has a strong mineral exploration, mainly of iron ore, the objective of this work is to evaluate if the creation of this area of ​​environmental protection, in 1994, managed to mitigate the unrestrained growth of mining. To achieve the objective, satellite images Lansat 5 (for the years 1984, 1995 and 2006) and Landsat 8 (for the year 2019) were used, making a 35-year temporal analysis. Next, the best RGB composition was determined to identify the minerals and, consequently, the mining areas, thus enabling us to create polygons in the mining areas over the years studied. In the end, by calculating the area of ​​these polygons, it was possible to determine the growth of mining expansion over the years, which showed a decrease in its expansion between 1995 and 2006, which may be linked to the effect of the creation of APA in 1994.</p>

        <h2> Leiria District Fire Risk Charter</h2>
        <h3> Academic Study, Porto - Portugal</h3>   
        <p>Forest fires are one of the elements that shaped Mediterranean ecosystems and landscapes, and the frequency and intensity of these phenomena have made them a recurring phenomenon. In Portugal, fires have accompanied grazing in addition to the deforestation of forests, which ends up contributing to the regression of diverse forest ecosystems. Historical records show that the District of Leiria, has a long history of forest fires, with such a characteristic history of fires, the District of Leiria was chosen as the study area for this work that aims to put the knowledge obtained into practice. in Spatial Analysis and Spatial Planning classes and develop a district fire risk chart. The methodology of this work was based on a multicriteria analysis, using a hierarchical analytical method that resulted in a fire risk chart where, we can verify that a large part of the municipality has medium, high and very high risk, being, therefore, a district very susceptible to forest fires, especially the North and Northeast regions that have the highest concentration of areas at very high risk of fires.</p>
